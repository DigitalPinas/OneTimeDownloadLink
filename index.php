        <h2>Brief</h2><br>
		<p>This script was written to be a very easy way for non-programmers to be able to create a secure way to share a single file. It is ideal for 
		bands looking to give a single song to a single person, and invalidating the link once the song has been downloaded. However, 
		it will work for any type of file.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Description</h2><br>
		<p>This script allows you to generate a unique link to download a file. This file will only be allowed to be downloaded one time. 
		This link will also have also have an expiration date set on it.</p>
		<br>
		<p>For instance, if you wanted to sell a song for your band. You sold the song on your website for $1, you could use this script 
		to allow that person to download your song only one time. It would only give them a limited number of hours/days/weeks/years 
		to claim their download.</p>
		<br>
		<p>You can also mask the name of the file being downloaded, for further protection. For example, if your song was called 
		"greatsong.zip", you could set the download link as "Band_Awesome-Awesome_Song.zip" (it is not a good idea to leave spaces in URL titles)</p>
    <h2>Update</h2><br>
    <p>On July 11, 2016 a multi-file feature branch was merged with the single file. It is now possible to download multiple files at once. </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Example</h2><br>
        <p><a href="/OneTimeDownloadLink/generate.php?1234">Generate a download link</a></p>
